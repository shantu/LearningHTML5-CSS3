                        <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>

                        <p> Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t 
                            end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the 
                            vations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most 
                            effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and 
                            allows it to succeed.
                        </p>

                        <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design,
                            both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others 
                            don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked 
                            within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
                        </p>

                        <h5>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h5>

                        <p> Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written 
                            narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To 
                            do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, 
                            emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told 
                            story.
                        </p>

                        <p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical 
                            aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic 
                            patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we might look to 
                            them for inspiration.

                        <h5>ABOUT ADAM</h5>

                        <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, 
                            creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ 
                            years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, 
                            film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes 
                            that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering 
                            that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com

                        <p> JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js 
                            and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This talk will share tips 
                            on how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.

                        <p> Perception influences decisions, especially when it comes to selling products and services. Learn why 
                            before you even start sales conversations; good, thoughtful design and presentation will define

                        <p> Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by 
                            allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid 
                            prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and 
                            improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.

                        <p> Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to the high jump 
                            with an unorthodox “back first” technique that became known as the Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a 
                            sport that seemed to have reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him “the world’s 
                            laziest high jumper” — but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almost every high jumper.
                        </p>
                        <p>We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web, mobile and device interfaces have 
                            evolved from systems and processes that no longer connect with our audiences’ realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor 
                            to “save” information, push buttons as control devices and typography standards derived from mechanical typesetting.
                        </p>
                        <p>As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and to free ourselves from 
                            outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions of the future.
                        </p>

                        <p> Play isn’t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that – and the stickiness of a badge and 
                            a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience isn’t about those surface elements either – it’s about creating an environment 
                            with well-understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you’re trying to encourage people – or yourself – to 
                            save money or to lose weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be the trump card you’re looking for.

                        <h5>HEAVY METAL CODING</h5>

                        <p> In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks
                            in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning – both of code and drum 
                            beats! You’ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner’s heavy metal drum patterns.
                            The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration 
                            than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.

                        <p> By setting constraints, we force ourselves to be more productive. They help us make decisions, 
                            creating focus around the problem we are trying to solve. They improve our consistency, which 
                            provides a better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a valuable asset in times of 
                            innovation.
